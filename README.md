# CCWC 
A `wc` clone written in python.

It can:
+ count lines
+ count bytes
+ count words
(more to be added soon)

# Description (from the man page of wc)
`wc (1)               - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file`

# Motivation
I got inspired from Coding Challenges: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc
