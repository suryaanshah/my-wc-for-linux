# CCWC 
A `wc` clone written in python.

It can:
+ count lines 
+ count bytes
+ count words
(more to be added soon)

# Functioning
This will work exactly like the `wc` command. Download the `.py` file then:
+ count lines: `python3 ccwc.py -l test.txt`
+ count bytes: `python3 ccwc.py -c test.txt`
+ count words: `python3 ccwc.py -w test.txt`

Replace `test.txt` with any text file.

# Description (from the man page of wc)
`wc (1)               - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file`

# Motivation
I got inspired from Coding Challenges: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc
